The dataset used in this project has not been committed. In order to get the full raw dataset you have to downloaded it from the relative kaggle page [inserie link]. Running the script 'src/scripts/download_data.py' after configuring your Kaggle credetianls will automatically dowload the raw dataset into yout project folder, creating a new directory 'data/raw_imgs'.

Those images are not processed nor augmented.

If you want to obtain the processed and the augmented images you have to run another script: [aggiungi quando pronto].

Hope this helps!
